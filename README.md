# Data Product Definitions template

This repository contains a minimal set of resources that are necessary to get started
with defining your own Data Product Definitions.

# Repo structure

- [./src](./src) - Definition sources in python format
- [./DataProducts](./DataProducts) - Final Definitions as OpenAPI 3.0 specs
- [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) - Pre-configured CI workflows for validating
  and converting definitions from sources

# Getting started

Press `Use this template` to create a new repo from this template and define your data
products there.

Please check the [Contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to submit new
data product definitions in this repo.

## Python sources

Each python file located in the `src` folder is treated as a Data Product definition.

For example, `src/AirQuality/Current.py` defines `AirQuality/Current` data product.

These files are then converted to OpenAPI 3.0 specs, which are final forms of
definitions. To make the converter work correctly, each file must follow the same
structure:

```python
from pydantic import Field

from converter import CamelCaseModel, DataProductDefinition


class Request(CamelCaseModel):
    ...


class Response(CamelCaseModel):
    ...


DEFINITION = DataProductDefinition(
    description="...",
    request=Request,
    response=Response,
    route_description="...",
    summary="...",
)

```

Considering `CamelCaseModel` is a subclass of `pydantic`'s `BaseModel`, it's better to
understand how to use this library. Please read
[pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)'s documentation if you're not familiar
with it yet.

Each data product definition represented as python file must define a `DEFINITION`
variable which is an instance of `DataProductDefinition` class.

DataProductDefinition is a structure consisting of:

- `summary`

  Summary used in top of OpenAPI spec

- `description`

  Data product description, used in top of OpenAPI spec (defaults to the summary if not
  provided)

- `request`

  pydantic model describing body of POST request

- `response`

  pydantic model describing expected response from data source

- `route_summary`

  Summary for the POST route

- `route_description`

  Description for the POST route (defaults to the summary if not provided)

- `requires_authorization`

  Marks the Authorization header as required

- `requires_consent`

  Marks the X-Consent-Token header as required

### Example

There's an example of Data Product Definition for current weather:

```python
from pydantic import Field

from converter import CamelCaseModel, DataProductDefinition


class CurrentWeatherMetricRequest(CamelCaseModel):
    lat: float = Field(
        ...,
        title="Latitude",
        description="The latitude coordinate of the desired location",
        ge=-90.0,
        le=90.0,
        example=60.192059,
    )
    lon: float = Field(
        ...,
        title="Longitude",
        description="The longitude coordinate of the desired location",
        ge=-180.0,
        le=180.0,
        example=24.945831,
    )


class CurrentWeatherMetricResponse(CamelCaseModel):
    humidity: float = Field(..., title="Current relative air humidity in %", example=72)
    pressure: float = Field(..., title="Current air pressure in hPa", example=1007)
    rain: bool = Field(
        ..., title="Rain status", description="If it's currently raining or not."
    )
    temp: float = Field(
        ..., title="Current temperature in Celsius", example=17.3, ge=-273.15
    )
    wind_speed: float = Field(..., title="Current wind speed in m/s", example=2.1, ge=0)
    wind_direction: float = Field(
        ...,
        title="Current wind direction in meteorological wind direction degrees",
        ge=0,
        le=360,
        example=220.0,
    )


DEFINITION = DataProductDefinition(
    description="Data Product for current weather with metric units",
    request=CurrentWeatherMetricRequest,
    response=CurrentWeatherMetricResponse,
    route_description="Current weather in metric units",
    summary="Current Weather (Metric)",
)
```
