# Data Product Definitions template

This repository contains minimal set of resources that are necessary to get started with
defining your own Data Product Definitions.

# Repo structure

- [src](./src) - Definition sources in python format
- [DataProducts](./DataProducts) - Final Definitions as OpenAPI 3.0 specs
- [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) - Pre-configured CI for validating and
  converting definitions from sources

# Getting started

1. Press `Use template` to create a new repo from this template
2. Define your own data products as python files under `src/`. Technically, you can go
   ahead and create final specs under `DataProducts` folder if it's easier for you.
   However, recommended approach is using python sources and the automatic converter

## Python sources
